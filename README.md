## INTRODUCTION
Cubbit Vault is an advanced online file encryption and decryption tool that helps user
to encrypt files on client side,
making it less vulnerable in the
internet space and decreasing itâ€™s
chances of getting viewed by third
party.

Client-side encryption means that the client is
encrypting the data and NOT sharing the key with
the server. When done properly, this would prevent
anyone without the key from deciphering the data.

## SPECIFICATIONS

1) Frontend - React
2) Backend - Node.JS
3) Data Interity Check - SHA256SUM
4) Database - MongoDB

## Time Line of the Project

* **Date : 24th -25th April (Saturday & Sunday)**

Getting Started with the R&D bulding the prototype of the project, stack overflowing, googling and reading about the need of client side encryption.

* **Date : 26th-30th April (Weekdays)**

Reading along and coding bit by bit, failing and refactoring the code to attain basic functinality.

* **Date : 1st-2nd-3rd May (Long Weekend)**

3 day long sprint to finish the project with it's totally functionality. P.S : UI is still missing :'), preparing presentation/ demo video and flowcharts.

## How To Test This Project

1) Fork this repository

2) Clone to make a native copy.

3) Navigate to the client-side folder and run ```npm install``` to install node utilities.

4) Navigate to the server-side folder and run ```npm install``` to install node utilities.

5) Once node utilities are installed run ```npm start``` on each of the folders.

## What More Can Be Done

1) Enhace the UI 
2) Perform certain Validation Checks to make sure apps doesnt fails on edge case scenarios.
3) Additional Dark and Light mode toggle button (this feature is something I'm really interested about :))

##  Final Note

This was certainly a fun project that really helped me enhance my knowledge and skill set on Web Development, this was certainly not the best delivery and I totally admit that much better could have been done, but given time as a big constraint, I'm happy to atleast make it functional.

Apart from Web Dev skillset I got to learn a lot about confidential computing on client side and it's advantages.This project really helped me in up-sklling and upgrading myself and really made me re-think about the security concerns, and reminded myself "Why I want to work in the Confidential Computing Space". 

If you are still reading this Readme.md then my friend, I owe you huge respect, thanks for bearing with me till now and hope to see you soon.

Till Then Take Care & Stay Safe, E BUONA GIORNATA.
